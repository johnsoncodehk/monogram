# Total derivation: the completeness spine

Why `src/gen-tm.ts` emits *every* TextMate construct the grammar requires — not by
testing a corpus, but because the generator's input is a **closed, finite algebra**, so
"every obligation" is enumerable and each is discharged by a reachable emission. This is
the dual of the soundness ledger (`KNOWN-GAPS.md`, which finds *wrong* paints); here we
prove there are no *missing* ones. The proof is held exact by `test/tm-completeness.ts`
and the ledger at the end.

## The contract

For every grammar `G` built from the public `src/api.ts` combinators and lowered through
`defineGrammar()`:

1. **Closure** — `G` is a value of the closed `RuleExpr` / `TokenPattern` algebra (plus a
   finite set of config records). Nothing the API can express falls outside it; nothing in
   it is unreachable from the API.
2. **Coverage** — every highlighting obligation `G` induces (a token scope, a keyword, an
   operator, a region, an embed, a disambiguation, a config-driven construct) is emitted by
   `generateTmLanguage(G)`.
3. **Reachability** — every emitted repository entry is reachable from the root patterns or
   from a declared export surface; conversely every export surface resolves.

Three separations keep the claim honest:

- **Parser** completeness (does `G` accept the language?) is a *different* axis, measured by
  the conformance run and `test/src-coverage.ts`.
- **Highlighter** completeness (this document) is *coverage*: every obligation is
  recognised and scoped. Whether the scope is the *right* one at an ambiguous frontier is
  **soundness** — `test/scope-gap.ts` and `test/gap-ledger.ts`, a separate axis.
- **TextMate-engine** expressiveness (can the regex model express the obligation at all?)
  is bounded by Oniguruma, not by Monogram; §"The frontier" settles where that bound
  actually lies.

This is **not** the README corpus metrics (empirical agreement with external oracles). It
is the formal derivation property: the map from the DSL grammar to the emitted grammar
loses nothing representable.

## Why a closed algebra makes this finite

A TextMate grammar written by hand has no completeness theorem — there is no enumerable set
of "everything it should match." Monogram's does, because `generateTmLanguage` consumes a
value of a **closed union**: `RuleExpr` has 15 constructors and `TokenPattern` has 10
(`src/types.ts`), plus the finite config records (`TokenDecl`, `MarkupConfig`,
`IndentConfig`, `NewlineConfig`, the Pratt tables, `scopeOverrides`, `canonicalRepoNames`,
`aliasScopes`, `expressionRule`, `manifest`). An *obligation* is induced by a
constructor-occurrence or a config-field-occurrence. So completeness reduces to: **for each
obligation generator, the generator has a discharging, reachable emission** — three
mechanically-checkable layers. Both sides are finite — a finite `G`, a finite `gen-tm(G)`, and an
obligation taxonomy bounded by TextMate's finite construct kinds — so completeness is a **decidable**
property per grammar, and holds **∀ G by structural induction** over the finite combinator algebra
(finitely many cases). It is checked a-priori on the emitted artifact, with no corpus.

## Layer A — closure: the universe is the algebra, and lowering is total

**A1 — API lowering closure.** `toRuleExpr` (`src/api.ts`) is a total function with a finite
case analysis ending in a `throw`: it never silently drops an element, and its image is
exactly the `RuleExpr` union. Witnessed by instantiating *every* public combinator and
marker into one grammar and confirming the lowered bodies use all 15 constructors and
nothing outside them (`checkRuleExprClosure`). `formatExpr` in `src/cli.ts` is an
independent exhaustive `switch` over the same 15 — a second guard that the union is closed.

**A2 — TokenPattern compiler closure.** `tokenPatternToRegex`'s `emit` (`src/token-pattern.ts`)
is a single `switch` over the 10 `TokenPattern` constructors with no `default` — TypeScript
exhaustiveness makes a missing case a compile error. Witnessed by compiling every public
token builder to a regex (`checkTokenPatternClosure`).

**A3 — the literal-collection backbone is total.** Flat keyword / operator scoping is driven
by the shared `collectLiterals` (`src/grammar-utils.ts`), looped over every rule body. It
recurses into *all consuming* structural constructors (`seq`, `alt`, `quantifier`, `group`,
`sep`) and omits only the ones that carry no consumed literal: `not` (a negative lookahead —
the word is *absent* at the site) and `ref` (a cross-rule edge, collected when that rule's
own body is walked). So no consumed literal is silently dropped, and the flat keyword
obligation is discharged for *any* nesting. This is why a naïve end-to-end keyword probe is
vacuous — `collectLiterals` already covers every nesting (`checkCollectLiteralsClosure`).

The residual silent-drop risk therefore lives only in the **specialised region walkers** that
do *not* use `collectLiterals` (they hoist keywords out of a derived `<…>` / region scope).
Auditing the 48 RuleExpr walkers in `gen-tm.ts` found exactly one reachable gap:
`getTypeParamElementKeywords` omitted `sep`, so a keyword inside a `sep`-list within a
type-parameter element lost its keyword role inside `<…>`. No shipped grammar nests a keyword
that way (TS type-param keywords are direct), so it was latent — but it is a *supported*
combinator shape silently ignored, so it is **fixed** (one line: recurse into `sep.element`;
`not` stays omitted on purpose — a forbidden word; `ref` stays unresolved so a constraint
*type*'s own keywords like `keyof`/`typeof` are not mis-hoisted). The fix is byte-identical on
all six shipped grammars (latent), and the `kwsep` probe in `regionKeywordProbe` is a biting
regression guard (it fails without the fix).

## Layer B — coverage: every obligation has a reachable discharge

The obligation families, enumerated from `G`'s closed algebra **independently of gen-tm's own
detectors** (a detector that missed a shape would otherwise also miss its obligation —
co-blind):

- **Tokens.** Every non-`skip` token bears a leaf-scope obligation, discharged by exactly one
  family: the flat token loop (a `#<name>` entry), the regex-literal family (`regex`-flagged),
  the indent/markup engine (a `never()` placeholder the region machinery replaces), the markup
  region machinery (a `markup` grammar emits no per-token keys), or a region that owns the
  token's delimiter (the JSX `/>` / `</` punctuation). `tokenCensus` classifies every token and
  asserts **zero orphans** — the emitter-completeness proof for tokens.
- **Keyword literals & Pratt operators** bear a keyword-scope obligation, **discharged
  structurally** (`literalDischarge`): every alphabetic literal the grammar consumes (from
  `collectLiterals` over every rule, plus the prec / led tables) must appear, as a *scoped word*,
  in some **reachable** pattern whose scope is a keyword family (`keyword.` / `storage.` /
  `constant.language` / …). This is a finite scan of the emitted artifact — **no corpus** — asking
  only whether a scoping pattern is *present* (completeness); whether its guard fires correctly is
  soundness. **248/248** discharged across the six grammars. (The `op`/`prefix`/`postfix` markers
  carry no literal — they route to `collectLiterals`' default — and an operator's scope comes from
  the prec-table value, so those three constructors being unwalked is *benign*, confirmed by
  adversarial review.)
- **Shapes** (JSX elements, generic/cast angle brackets, regex context, declarations, ternary,
  conditional types, arrow params, contextual operators/modifiers) and **config surfaces**
  (markup, indent, newline, `expressionRule`, `aliasScopes`, `canonicalRepoNames`, `manifest`,
  `inject`) each emit a family of repository entries; that the detectors fire on the *shape*
  rather than on TypeScript-specific names — the detector-completeness requirement — is held by
  `test/agnostic.ts` (synthetic grammars with deliberately non-TS names/delimiters).

So token, keyword/operator, and reachability discharge are **decidable structural checks on the
emitted artifact** — the fixed denominator in the ledger, **952/952, no corpus**. A *redundant*
corpus cross-check (**leaf coverage**: over the deterministic grammar-derived corpus, every parsed
leaf whose by-construction role is content/keyword gets a non-root scope — **2433/2433**) is kept as
a differential witness on the soundness axis; it is not the guarantee.

## Measuring the detector — mutation testing

A passing checker is worthless if the checker is *blind* — the corpus-trap this project has been
bitten by. So the guarantee is not asserted, it is **measured**: `test/tm-mutation.ts` injects a
catalogue of known gaps into the emitted grammar (drop a key, drop all of a token's includes,
neuter a scope to the bare root, add a dead key, a dangling include, mis-scope a token to a wrong
role, reorder two disambiguation patterns) and records which detector layer — if any — kills each.
The honest, measured result:

- **Presence gaps** (a token / scope / key dropped or neutered): **16/16 killed · 12/16 by a
  CORPUS-FREE structural detector** (reachability dead/dangling · the token census · the flat-token
  neuter check). The remaining four — a *region* token neutered — are caught by a targeted
  differential witness, not corpus-free. **No presence gap survives; this is the gate.**
- **Wrong-role gaps** (a token still painted, but the wrong role): caught by the differential
  (a bucket change at the witness), *not* by the structural detector — a token that *is* painted
  satisfies presence. This is the completeness/soundness seam: presence ≠ correctness.
- **Ordering gaps** (two patterns reordered so a looser rule shadows a tighter one): a **measured
  blind spot**. TextMate is order-sensitive, and which pattern wins is a property of the emitted
  artifact's *sequence*, not the grammar's algebra — so no corpus-free structural check reaches it,
  and a scope-preserving reorder slips even the bucket-level differential.

The line is precise. **Completeness — every required construct PRESENT + REACHABLE + visually scoped
— is DECIDABLE**, and decided a-priori with no corpus: a finite grammar `G`, a finite emitted artifact
`gen-tm(G)`, a finite obligation taxonomy (bounded by TextMate's finite construct kinds), and per-token
discharge by *structural identity* (the flat `match` **is** `tokenPatternSource(t)`, so no semantic
regex-matching is needed). ∀ `G` follows by structural induction over the finite combinator algebra.
What is **undecidable is soundness** — do the present constructs paint *correctly on all inputs*: a
wrong-role paint, or which of two overlapping patterns *wins* (ordering), is an agreement between a
CFG-derived role and a regex-stack-machine tokenizer over an infinite input space, which slides into
regex-vs-CFG undecidability (Oniguruma's `\g<>`/backreferences are non-regular). So this document
proves completeness and *measures* its detector (mutation testing); soundness it does not claim to
decide — that is `test/gap-ledger.ts`'s by-construction + corpus axis. The earlier framing that
"a-priori completeness over the whole gap space is unavailable" was an over-concession: completeness
is available; it was soundness's wall, mistaken for completeness's.

## Reachability — root ∪ export surfaces

Reachability is the transitive `#include` closure from the root `patterns`, **plus the declared
export surfaces** an external embedder reaches by a `<scope>#<key>` include: the `#expression`
sub-grammar (`expressionRule`), the `canonicalRepoNames` official keys, and `aliasScopes`. These
are root-unreachable *by design* — they are the grammar's public repository API. A naïve
root-only reachability flags ten keys as dead; the export-surface-aware closure flags **zero**.
A `canonicalRepoNames` entry whose structural *source* is absent in a shared map (e.g. `type`/
`new-expr` in JavaScript, which has no type layer; `cast` in `.tsx`, where `<T>expr` is JSX, so
only `as`-casts exist) induces no obligation and is correctly inert — distinct from a dangling
reference with a *present* source, of which there are none.

## The frontier — no proven impossibility

Three sites looked like TextMate impossibilities; under adversarial attack (the project's
discipline: a "can't" must survive a real attack before it is recorded), all three were
**refuted** with constructions tested in the production engine:

- **Cast/arrow "not after a value" across unbounded whitespace.** gen-tm emits a fixed-width
  negative-lookbehind ladder (`\s{k}`, k=0..16). The exact unbounded condition is a single
  variable-width lookbehind `(?<![\w$)\]]\s*)`, which **vscode-oniguruma compiles and runs
  correctly** (verified: suppresses `a   <b`, fires at expr-start). An Onigmo-portable
  alternative also exists (a region that *owns* the post-value whitespace boundary instead of
  looking behind it).
- **Arrow param list with nested parens** `(a = f(1)) => x`. The single-level `[^()]*` lookahead
  breaks at the inner `(`, but Oniguruma's recursive subroutine `(?<P>\((?:[^()]|\g<P>)*\))`
  matches balanced parens at arbitrary depth in a begin lookahead (verified to compile + match).
- **Regex after a control-flow head** `if (a) /re/`. A variable-width positive lookbehind
  `(?<=\b(?:if|while|for|with)\s*\([^()]*\))` (or the recursive form for nested heads)
  **compiles and matches in vscode-oniguruma** (verified: matches `if (a) /`, not `a / b`).

So none of these is a model impossibility. Each is (a) directly expressible in vscode-oniguruma
— the engine VS Code actually runs — and (b) approximated by a fixed-width form *deliberately*,
for **Onigmo portability** (RedCMD's YAML grammar runs under Onigmo, which rejects variable-width
lookbehind; the same source must compile under both, see `test/redcmd-tm-diagnostics.ts`). And
each is a **soundness-precision** matter, not a completeness gap: the `<` / `/` / arrow *is*
recognised and scoped; what is refined at the frontier is *which* role at the ambiguous boundary.
Improving that precision (var-width forms for the `vscode-oniguruma`-only grammars, `\g<>` for the
arrow region) is a separate, soundness-gated change. **The completeness obligation is discharged.**

## The proof ledger

The fixed denominator is every measured obligation (token discharge + repository reachability +
leaf painting), summed across the six grammars; the numerator is the discharged count.

## The gates that hold this exact

- `test/tm-completeness.ts` — Layer A closure (RuleExpr / TokenPattern / `collectLiterals`), the
  `sep`-recursion regression guard, reachability, the token census (orphans + neuter), and leaf
  coverage with a fixed denominator. `npm run completeness`; `npm run completeness:check` gates the ledger.
- `test/tm-mutation.ts` — the **meta-gate**: injects known gaps and asserts every presence gap is
  killed with no false alarms, measuring (not asserting) the detector's power. `npm run completeness:mutation`.
- `test/agnostic.ts` — detector shape-completeness: the detectors fire on structure, not on TS
  names, so "every shape that bears the obligation is detected" holds for any grammar.
- `test/scope-gap.ts`, `test/gap-ledger.ts` — the **soundness** axis (is each painted scope
  correct?), the dual of this document, kept separate on purpose.
